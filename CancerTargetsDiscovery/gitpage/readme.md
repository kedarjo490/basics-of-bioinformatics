<h1>Exploring Understudied Human Protein-Coding Genes in Cancer</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this project, I explored a group of understudied human protein-coding genes to evaluate their potential relevance in cancer. In addition to four provided genes, I selected five underrepresented genes: <strong>EMC9, FAM171A2, PDIK1L, DBNDD2, CASKIN2</strong>, based on limited functional annotation in UniProt, Pfam/InterPro, and the literature. For each gene, basic information on predicted domains, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and expression patterns was compiled.</p>

<p>Using <strong>GEPIA2</strong>, tumor and normal expression across TCGA and GTEx datasets was compared. Notable trends include EMC9 overexpression in thymoma and DLBCL, and PDIK1L survival associations in kidney cancer. RNA-protein comparisons using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) revealed some RNA-protein mismatches, which are expected for low-expression, poorly characterized genes. Single-cell RNA-seq datasets (GSE72056 and GSE115978) showed consistent cell-type expression patterns. A scalable Seurat workflow was developed to integrate multiple scRNA-seq datasets for cluster-level summaries. Overall, this study highlights how minimal public data can provide preliminary clues about uncharacterized genes, some of which may warrant further investigation in cancer biology.</p>

<h2>Cancer Target Discovery</h2>

<h3>Identifying and Characterizing Understudied Human Protein-Coding Genes</h3>

<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Genes were selected based on three criteria: (i) truly understudied, (ii) minimal known function, and (iii) detectable expression in human tissues or cancers suitable for analysis using TCGA and GTEx data.</p>

<h4>Seed Genes</h4>
<p>The exercise provided four initial genes: <strong>C1orf174, LOC124903857, TMEM161B, ZNF808</strong>. These served as anchors for defining criteria for poorly characterized protein-coding genes.</p>

<h4>Finding Tdark Genes</h4>
<p>Using the <strong>Pharos (NIH IDG)</strong> platform, genes were classified into Target Development Levels (TDLs):</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tclin:</strong> established drug targets</li>
    <li><strong>Tchem:</strong> targets with small molecule interactions</li>
    <li><strong>Tbio:</strong> targets with substantial biological information</li>
    <li><strong>Tdark:</strong> targets with very little functional information, few publications, limited GO terms, and scarce protein domain data</li>
</ul>

<p>Selection filters for Tdark genes included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2–10 PubMed publications</li>
    <li>Minimal Gene Ontology annotations</li>
    <li>Unreviewed UniProt (TrEMBL) entries with low annotation scores (≤2/5)</li>
    <li>Few or no recognized protein domains in InterPro/Pfam</li>
    <li>Limited proof of protein expression</li>
</ul>

<h4>Final Gene Panel</h4>
<p>Five Tdark genes were selected: <strong>EMC9, FAM171A2, PDIK1L, DBNDD2, CASKIN2</strong>.</p>

<h3>Expression in Cancer</h3>
<p>Across all nine genes, functional annotation was sparse. HPA data and GEPIA2 analyses revealed potential cancer relevance:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>EMC9:</strong> Low tissue specificity; modest RNA across normal tissues; protein moderate in colorectal, thyroid, prostate, and skin cancers. Discrepancies between RNA and protein suggest transcriptional activity with limited protein detection.
<br><br>

</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong>FAM171A2:</strong> Highest in cerebral cortex and epididymis; mostly weak or negative staining in cancers, with moderate cytoplasmic positivity in liver and thyroid.
<br><br>

<br>
<li>
<strong>PDIK1L:</strong> Low/moderate RNA across tissues; prognostic in kidney cancer (KIRC) with favorable survival association.
<br><br>

<br>
<li>
<strong>DBNDD2:</strong> Broadly expressed; high in gliomas; high expression correlates with poor prognosis across multiple cancers.

<strong>CASKIN2:</strong> Low/moderate RNA; strong protein in ovarian and stomach cancers; tumor-selective expression suggests potential tissue-specific roles.

          <li>Differences between RNA-seq cohorts and tissue microarrays</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>HPA RNA expression comes from large-scale bulk RNA-seq (GTEx, TCGA), providing robust quantitative data.</li>
      <li>HPA protein expression relies on immunohistochemistry, small sample sizes, and manual staining assessment.</li>
      <li>Discrepancies between RNA and protein are expected, especially for understudied Tdark genes.</li>
